#Q. 11: May to August
#The length of a month varies from 30 and 31 days. In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string.
#The program should get input from May to August. If the input is from may to other months then display error messages as "Invalid"

#Q. 12: Find Year
#Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in 
#some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:
#Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
#Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
#Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
#All other years are not leap years.
#Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.

else:

#Q. 13: BMI

#Q. 14: Game of Digits
#Develop a program that reads a four-digit integer from the user and displays the sum of the digits in the number. For example, if the user enters 3141 then your program should 
#display 3+1+4+1=9.

#Q. 16: Note To Frequency - D NOTE
#The following table lists an octave of music notes, beginning with middle D, along with their frequencies.
#Note Frequency (Hz) D4 293.66 Begin by writing a program that reads the name of a note from the user and displays the notes frequency.
#Your program should support all of the notes listed previously. Once you have your program working correctly for the notes listed previously you should add support for all of 
#the notes from D0 to D8.
#While this could be done by adding many additional cases to your if statement, such a solution is cumbersome, inelegant and unacceptable for the purposes of this exercise.
#Instead, you should exploit the relationship between notes in adjacent octaves. In particular, the frequency of any note in octave n is half the frequency of the corresponding 
#note in octave n+1.
#By using this relationship, you should be able to add support for the additional notes without adding additional cases to your if statement.

#Q. 17: Name that Triangle
#A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
#All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length.
#An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length.
#If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.
#Write a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user. Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.

#Write a program that reads a month and day from the user. If the month and day match one of the holidays listed previously then your program should display the holidays name.
#Otherwise your program should indicate that the entered month and day do not correspond to a fixed-date holiday.
